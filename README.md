# A-Star-Path-Finding-Algorithm

A* or A Star Search algorithm is one of the best and popular technique used in path-finding and graph traversals.

## How to use:
Firstly, using your mouse cursor add the starting point. (orange point)</br>
Now add the target point. (cyan point)</br>
Now add the blocks/walls. (black blocks)</br>
It might look like this:</br></br>
